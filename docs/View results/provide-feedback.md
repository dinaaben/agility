# Provide feedback

Root cause feedback gathers qualitative insights on your experience with
Agility's machine-generated labels. Your feedback helps AGILITY\'s
development team understand the limitations and areas of improvement for
the system\'s label-detection algorithms.

There are two types of root cause feedback you can provide:

-   Feedback on the Call Flow root cause from the **Call Flow Details**
    page

-   Feedback on one of the root causes listed in the **Diagnostics** tab

To provide Call Flow Root Cause Feedback:

1.  [Navigate to the Call Flow
    Details](https://nexiusocp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020272113beb61f46609e5721d6521a154c/pages/3011740650/Internal+-+Analyze+Results+in+Call+Flow+Details#%5BinlineExtension%5DAccess-Your-Analyses)
    for the Call Flow that you'd like to leave feedback on.

2.  On the top of the page, next to the classification, select one:

    1.  Thumbs up if you agree with the root cause provided.

    2.  Thumbs down if you disagree with the root cause provided.\
        To de-select, select your choice again.

3.  (Optional) Once you choose thumbs up/down, you can provide
    additional feedback, select the classifications you agree/disagree
    with, and select **Submit Feedback**.

To provide feedback on a specific root cause listed in the
**Diagnostics** tab:
