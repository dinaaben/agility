often used in communication between network elements, such as between a
user\'s device and a Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) in mobile
networks.

## **NAS**
NAS (Non-Access Stratum) is a layer in the LTE protocol stack that handles signaling between the User Equipment (UE) and the Evolved NodeB (eNB) in mobile networks. It includes functions related to mobility, security, and session management.

The single N1 termination point is located in AMF. The single N1 NAS signaling connection is used for both Registration Management and Connection Management (RM/CM) and for SM-related messages and procedures for a UE.<br/>The NAS protocol on N1 comprises a NAS-MM and a NAS-SM components.<br/>There are multiple cases of protocols between the UE and a core network function (excluding the AMF) that need to be transported over N1 via NAS-MM protocol.<br/>The 5G MM procedures can only be performed if a NAS signaling connection has been established between the UE and the AMF. If there is no active signaling connection, the 5G MM layer has to initiate the establishment of a NAS signaling connection.  When no active connection, the 5GMM layer has to establish NAS signaling by Registration or Service Request procedure</p><p>Initial Registration and Setup:</p><p>- Attach Request (UE to AMF): UE initiates the registration process. Includes UE identity, capabilities, and initial registration information.</p><p>- Registration Accept (AMF to UE): AMF accepts the UE registration. Provides necessary information and parameters.</p><p>- Security Activation (UE to AMF): Activation of security mechanisms to protect communication.</p><p>- PDU Session Establishment (UE to AMF): Request for establishing a PDU (Packet Data Unit) session. Includes information like QoS parameters.</p><p>UE Context Release:</p><p>- Detach Request (UE to AMF): UE initiates detachment from the network. May include reasons for detachment.</p><p>- UE Context Release Command (AMF to UE): AMF commands the UE to release its context.</p><p>Reference : 3GPP TS 23.501 , TS 38.413, TS 38.401 and TS 38.410</p>|

## **SIP**
SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a signaling protocol used for initiating, modifying, and terminating communication sessions, including voice and video calls over IP networks. It is commonly used in VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) and multimedia communication applications.

|<h4>**SIP\_Call**</h4>|UE--P/I/S-CSCF--TAS (Gm-Mw-ISC-Mx-Mr)|SIP + sip\_subflow\_type|<p>The establishment of the VoLTE session (call) includes the following operations:<br/>– the negotiation of the characteristics of real-time transport protocol<br/>(RTP) streams via session description protocol (SDP);<br/>– the establishment of dedicated bearer to the RTP stream.</p><p>The initial stages of setting up a VoLTE call are the processes of the initial attach, P-CSCF discovery and creating the default bearer for SIP signaling (by registering with the IMS network and subscribing to a registration event package).</p><p>The first step in a VoLTE call setup is a SIP INVITE request initiated by the calling UE. Following this step, agreement is made on the media-specific parameters such as codecs (e.g. AMR or WB-AMR). After some RINGING, TRYING and OK messaging, the calling UE may respond with a Provisional ACK (PRACK) method as defined in RFC 3551. The PRACK method is used because ACK cannot safely traverse proxy servers that comply with RFC 3261. The PRACK is also forwarded to the called UE. When the called subscriber answers the call, the called UE will respond with a 200 OK before the RTP (media) messaging begins.</p><p>Reference : 3GPP TS 24.229</p>|
|<h4>**SIP\_De-Registration**</h4>|UE--P/I/S-CSCF--HSS (Gm-Mw-Cx)|SIP + sip\_subflow\_type|<p>The deregistration phase starts when the UA entity transmits a REGISTER message which parameter expires of the header Contact has a zero value.</p><p>- The I-CSCF entity transmits to the HSS entity the DIAMETER LIR message to retrieve the IP address of S-CSCF.</p><p>- The HSS entity provides the IP address of the S-CSCF entity in the DIAMETER LIA message.</p><p>- The I-CSCF entity sends to the S-CSCF entity the REGISTER request.</p><p>- The S-CSCF entity transmits to the HSS entity the DIAMETER SAR message informing about deregistration of the mobile. The HSS entity still retains the identity of the S-CSCF entity to allow the use of services when the mobile is not registered, such as call forwarding to voicemail.</p><p>- The HSS entity transmits the DIAMETER SAA message to acknowledge the previous request.</p><p>- The S-CSCF entity informs UA entity of its deregistration in a NOTIFY message.</p><p>- The 200 OK message is a response to the NOTIFY request.</p><p>- The S-CSCF entity informs the TAS entity about the deregistration of UA entity in a NOTIFY message.</p><p>- The 200 OK message is a response to the NOTIFY request.</p><p>- The S-CSCF entity informs the P-CSCF entity about the deregistration of UA entity in a NOTIFY message.</p><p>- The 200 OK message is a response to the NOTIFY request.</p><p>- The 200 OK message is a response to the REGISTER request.</p><p>Reference : 3GPP TS 24.229</p>|
|<h4>**SIP\_Registration**</h4>|UE--P/I/S-CSCF--HSS (Gm-Mw-Cx)|SIP + sip\_subflow\_type|<p>After Authentication, Security and UE Capability requests, the network accepts the Attach request and activates the EPS bearer context. Once that has happened and the UE has also established a PDP context, a typical IMS SIP client registration (Figure 4) begins:</p><p>- The IMS client attempts to register by sending a REGISTER request to the P-CSCF.</p><p>- The P-CSCF forwards the REGISTER request to the I-CSCF.</p><p>- The I-CSCF polls the HSS for data used to decide which S-CSCF should manage the REGISTER request. The I-CSCF then makes that decision.</p><p>- The I-CSCF forwards the REGISTER request to the appropriate S-CSCF.</p><p>- The S-CSCF typically sends the P-CSCF a 401 (UNAUTHORIZED) response as well as a challenge string in the form of a “number used once” or “nonce”.</p><p>- The P-CSCF forwards the 401 – UNAUTHORIZED response to the UE.</p><p>- Both the UE and the network have stored some Shared Secret Data (SSD), the UE in its ISIM or USIM and the network on the HSS. The UE uses an algorithm per RFC 33101 (e.g. AKAv2-MD5) to hash the SSD and the "nonce".</p><p>- The UE sends a REGISTER request to the P-CSCF. This time the request includes the result of the hashed nonce and SSD.</p><p>- The P-CSCF forwards the new REGISTER request to the I-CSCF.</p><p>- The I-CSCF forwards the new REGISTER request to the S-CSCF.</p><p>- The S-CSCF polls the HSS (via the I-CSCF) for the SSD, hashes it against the nonce and determines whether the UE should be allowed to register. Assuming the hashed values match, the S-CSCF sends 200 – OK response to the P-CSCF. At this point an IPSec security association is established by the P-CSCF.</p><p>- The P-CSCF forwards the 200 – OK response to the UE.</p><p>Reference : 3GPP TS 24.229</p>|
