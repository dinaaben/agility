<p>In the sequence diagram, you have the option to filter directly by
specific protocol procedures, allowing you to focus on analysis. All
procedures are defined using 3GPP definitions.</p>

<p>Diameter is a signaling protocol used in telecommunications for
authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) purposes. It is
often used in communication between network elements, such as between a
user&#x27;s device and a Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) in mobile
networks.</p>

<p>GTPv2 (GPRS Tunneling Protocol version 2) is a protocol used in mobile networks, particularly in the packet core network. It facilitates the communication between different network elements, such as between the Serving Gateway (SGW) and the PDN Gateway (PGW) in LTE (Long-Term Evolution) networks.</p>

This bearer forwards the data traffic received by the source eNB entity to the SGW entity to then be re-transmitted to the mobile via the target eNB entity.</p><p><strong>Mobility Management</strong>:</p><p>Mobility management messages are exchanged between the source and target MME entities, when the handover of the mobile imposes a switch of MME entity.<br>The source MME entity sends the target MME entity the FORWARD RELOCATION REQUEST message containing the context of the mobile.<br>The target MME entity responds with the FORWARD RELOCATION RESPONSE message when the resources needed for the handover have been reserved.<br>The response contains the values of the TEID parameter, which will enable the source SGW entity to redirect the traffic to the target SGW entity during handover.<br>Upon receiving this message, the source MME entity sends the source eNB entity the command to initiate handover.<br>The source MME entity sends the target MME entity the FORWARD ACCESS CONTEXT NOTIFICATION message to provide it with the elements of the context of the E-RAB bearer, such as the PDCP sequence number.<br>The target MME entity sends the source MME entity the FORWARD RELOCATION NOTIFICATION message to indicate that the handover procedure is complete.</p><p>The new MME entity sends the CONTEXT REQUEST message to the former one in the procedure of TAI updating, to retrieve information about the context of the mobile.<br>The former MME entity provides this information in the CONTEXT RESPONSE message, which may contain a positive or negative response.<br>The new MME entity acknowledges this previous message with the message CONTEXT ACKNOWLEDGE.<br>Reference:  3GPP TS 29.274-e10 </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The single N1 termination point is located in AMF. The single N1 NAS signaling connection is used for both Registration Management and Connection Management (RM/CM) and for SM-related messages and procedures for a UE.<br>The NAS protocol on N1 comprises a NAS-MM and a NAS-SM components.<br>There are multiple cases of protocols between the UE and a core network function (excluding the AMF) that need to be transported over N1 via NAS-MM protocol.<br>The 5G MM procedures can only be performed if a NAS signaling connection has been established between the UE and the AMF. If there is no active signaling connection, the 5G MM layer has to initiate the establishment of a NAS signaling connection.  When no active connection, the 5GMM layer has to establish NAS signaling by Registration or Service Request procedure</p><p>Initial Registration and Setup:</p><p>- Attach Request (UE to AMF): UE initiates the registration process. Includes UE identity, capabilities, and initial registration information.</p><p>- Registration Accept (AMF to UE): AMF accepts the UE registration.

<p>SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a signaling protocol used for initiating, modifying, and terminating communication sessions, including voice and video calls over IP networks. It is commonly used in VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) and multimedia communication applications.</p>

Following this step, agreement is made on the media-specific parameters such as codecs (e.g. AMR or WB-AMR). After some RINGING, TRYING and OK messaging, the calling UE may respond with a Provisional ACK (PRACK) method as defined in RFC 3551. The PRACK method is used because ACK cannot safely traverse proxy servers that comply with RFC 3261. The PRACK is also forwarded to the called UE. When the called subscriber answers the call, the called UE will respond with a 200 OK before the RTP (media) messaging begins.</p><p>Reference : 3GPP TS 24.229</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left"><h4><strong>SIP_De-Registration</strong></h4></td><td style="text-align:left">UE--P/I/S-CSCF--HSS (Gm-Mw-Cx)</td><td style="text-align:left">SIP + sip_subflow_type</td><td style="text-align:left"><p>The deregistration phase starts when the UA entity transmits a REGISTER message which parameter expires of the header Contact has a zero value.</p><p>- The I-CSCF entity transmits to the HSS entity the DIAMETER LIR message to retrieve the IP address of S-CSCF.</p><p>- The HSS entity provides the IP address of the S-CSCF entity in the DIAMETER LIA message.</p><p>- The I-CSCF entity sends to the S-CSCF entity the REGISTER request.</p><p>- The S-CSCF entity transmits to the HSS entity the DIAMETER SAR message informing about deregistration of the mobile.

The UE uses an algorithm per RFC 33101 (e.g. AKAv2-MD5) to hash the SSD and the &quot;nonce&quot;.</p><p>- The UE sends a REGISTER request to the P-CSCF.
