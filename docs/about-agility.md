# About AGILITY


## What is AGILITY?

AGILITY uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to
accelerate troubleshooting and validation processes by up to 80%.

AGILITY provides call flow visualization and protocol level analysis
that optimizes root error and root cause identification using network
record PCAPs (Packet Captures).

Using a three-step process, AGILITY isolates network issues by
systematically eliminating hypothetical problems:

1.  **Gather Data**: Upload PCAPs.

2.  **Analyze**: Isolate the issue(s) in network data and eliminate
    false probable causes.

3.  **Resolve**: Propose the remediation that can fix the issue.

The AGILITY UI visualizes and highlights the most significant network
errors so that engineers can quickly locate issues and get to work on
resolutions.
