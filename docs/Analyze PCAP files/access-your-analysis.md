|**Failed with Warning**|<p>The Failed with Warning status indicates that something went wrong during file processing. For example:</p><p>- A prediction script error on our end</p><p>- Auto-detection detected the incorrect service</p><p>- The user selected the incorrect service</p><p>- We do not have a model that is compatible with the network captures that were uploaded</p><p></p>|
